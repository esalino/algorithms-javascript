# algorithms-javasctipt

typical problem/algorithm samples mostly found on hackerrank
I'm trying to solve most of the same problems in 3 languages, Java, javasctipt and Python for a little comparison fun.
Why these 3? I have used Java the most, Javascript the most recently (last 3 years) and Python only a little but it is popular for a reason.
